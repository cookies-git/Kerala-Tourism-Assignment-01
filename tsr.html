                                    Watching the naughty baby elephants' playful antics is an entertaining experience. The place provides you an opportunity to watch how the sick elephants are medically treated in the traditional manner. One can also watch the training given to the elephants for various ritualistic performances.
                                    
                                    Remember you are in the land where people worship the elephant-faced god Lord Ganapathy. Groomimg elephants were considered a status symbol. With the decay of the joint family system, supporting elephants became a financial burden for many families. Gradually various temple managements took the charge of looking after these animals. Anyhow, even today elephants play a key role in Kerala's fairs and festivals.

                                    A resplendent festival celebrated with a grand display of caparisoned elephants, dazzling parasols, and percussion music, the Thrissur Pooram is a magnificent spectacle merging the spiritual and cultural essence of Kerala. Celebrated in the Malayalam month of medam (April-May), the pooram is held at the Thekkinkadu Maidanam in Thrissur. 

                                    Considered to be the mother of all poorams, this yearly temple festival was the brain child of Shakthan Thampuran, the Maharaja of Kochi, who organised the festival with the participation of 10 temples (Paramekkavu, Thiruvambadi Kanimangalam, Karamucku, Laloor, Choorakottukara, Panamukkampally, Ayyanthole, Chembukkavu, Neythilakavu).

                                    Guruvayur is home to the historic Sree Krishna Temple, called the Dwaraka of the South. It is among the most revered and popular pilgrimage destinations in Kerala and the entire country. The central shrine is believed to have been rebuilt in 1638 C.E. The architectural style and individual elements inside the shrine are beautiful representations of the history of the place.

                                    As per tradition, the shrine faces the East with two Gopurams (tower), one in the East (Kizhakkenada) and other in the West (Padinjarenada).  In the front and the east side of the Nalambalam (a square shaped column) lie the pillars of light called Deepastambam. There are a number of such light pillars in the temple. The eastern side’s Deepastambam is 24 feet in height and has thirteen circular receptacles, making it an absolutely spectacular sight when lit. Another famous sight here is the Dwajasthamba. It is a flag-staff, around 70 feet tall, fully covered with gold.
