                                Celebrated as the Granary of Kerala, Palakkad is a vast stretch of fertile plains interspersed with hills, rivers, mountain streams and forests. The gateway to Kerala from the north, a 40 kilometre break in the mountains known as the Palakkad Gap gives access to this land situated at the foot of the Western Ghats. The pass acts as a corridor between Kerala and the neighbouring Tamil Nadu and played a key role in the trade relations between the east and west coasts of peninsular India. Deriving its name from the Malayalam words Pala (Alsteriascholaris) and Kadu (forest), this place was once a stunning expanse of forest covered with the sweet-scented flowers of the Pala tree. A potpourri of Tamil and Kerala culture, some of the finest Carnatic musicians hail from this district which continues to be a principally agrarian society.

The height of the hills ranges from 467 m to 1,572 m and it has an extremely calming effect on all who view it. To reach Nelliyampathy, one has to take the road starting from Nenmara that proceeds to the Pothundy Dam. There are about 10 hairpin bends that have to be negotiated on the way to Nelliyampathy.

                                    The Pothundy Dam is a beautiful locale with facilities for boating and is a nice option as a picnic place. As the Ghat road winds its way up to Nelliyampathy, at certain places there are viewpoints from where the vast stretches of Palakkad district are visible with its extensive paddy fields forming a verdant carpet. It also offers a splendid view of the Palakkad Gap, which is a geographical phenomenon in the Western Ghats formation in this region, bringing into view, parts of the adjoining State of Tamil Nadu.

A few centuries ago, before humans reached the Silent Valley, this reserve of tropical rainforests stood undisturbed and tranquil like a perfectly hidden diamond.

                                    Located in the Northeast corner of Palakkad district, Silent Valley was named a National Park only in 1984. It was called 'Sairandhrivanam' as it was here that Sairandhiri (the secret identity donned by Panchali, from the epic Mahabharata) is believed to have hidden along with her five husbands, the Pandavas, while escaping their cruel cousins, the Kauravas. The Kunthippuzha River which feeds the entire forest was named after Kunthi, mother of the Pandavas. It is shielded by the Nilgiri Plateau to the North and the Mannarkkad Plains to the South. It constitutes the centrepiece of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, an integral part of the Western Ghats, christened a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2012

                                    Most people wouldn't expect giant chariots sweeping through their city streets. Well, to this day, one can view exotic, colourful chariots during the annual Ratholsavam (chariot festival) at Sree Viswanatha Swamy Temple at Kalpathi in Palakkad. The temple, dedicated to Lord Viswanatha or Shiva and built over 700 years ago, usually celebrates the festival during November. This event has been celebrated for centuries and devotees crowd the streets in large numbers. As the chariots pass, people can be seen dancing and celebrating throughout the route. Recitations of Vedic rituals and cultural programmes are held. The final three days brings three gigantic chariots to the roads and revelry reaches its crescendo. It is among the most extraordinary sights that God's Own Country has to offer.

The entire garden is made from broken pieces of bangles, tiles, used plastic cans, tins and other waste materials. Also situated in the gardens is the massive Malampuzha Yakshi (female vampire) built in 1969 by Kanayi Kunhiraman, a greatly respected sculptor from the state. It is a spectacular relic of art that we are lucky to still have with us. The flowering beds, fountains and rose gardens along with an aerial ropeway make it a place that instantly soothes your soul.

                                    The Parambikkulam Tiger Reserve is located between the Anamalai mountain ranges in the adjoining state of Tamilnadu and that of the Nelliampathi ranges in Kerala. This 285 sq km sanctuary in Palakkad district is one of Kerala's major wildlife reserves. This wildlife sanctuary is about 140 km from the town of Palakkad.

                                    The sanctuary with its hilly and rocky landscape teems with clusters of bamboo and also has highly valuable timber varieties like rosewood and teak. The sanctuary also has patches of grasslands and marsh lands. The biggest teak tree in the world - the Kannimari is located in the Parambikulam wildlife sanctuary. This tree is 47.5 m tall and has a girth of 642 cm.
                                    
                                    Parambikulam is rich in wildlife. It is estimated that the sanctuary is home to about 39 species of mammals, 16 species of amphibians, 268 species of birds, 61 species of reptiles, 47 species of fish and 124 species of butterflies; not to speak of a thousand odd species of insects.
